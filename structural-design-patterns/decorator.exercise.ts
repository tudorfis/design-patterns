// Exercise 

// We’re going to build a code editor like IntelliJ or VSCode.
// When we open a project, we should see all the artefacts (items) in that project.

// Every artefact should have an icon and the icon can be different from one artefact 
// to another. For example, the Main file’s icon has a special green play marker
// on top of the icon. Similarly, if an artefact includes errors, its icon should
// include an error marker.

// Run the code in the Demo class. We’re simulating the rendering of these 
// icons using simple strings. Next, look at the current implementation
// of these concepts in the decoratorpackage.

// Read my comments in the Artefact class about the problems
// with this implementation. Refactor the solution using the decorator pattern.
